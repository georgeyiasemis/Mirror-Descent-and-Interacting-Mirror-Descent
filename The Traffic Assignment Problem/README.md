# The Traffic Assignment Problem
This folder contains the code for the optimisation of the problem described in Section 5.1 in the project.

All three optimisation frameworks are contained in ``\run_opt.py``. The functions for the generation of random graphs are ``graph.py`` and ``generate_graph.py``.
