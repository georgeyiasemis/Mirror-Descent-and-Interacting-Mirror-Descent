# Laplacian K-modes for Clustering
This folder contains the code for the optimisation of the problem described in Section 5.4 in the project.

All three optimisation frameworks are contained in ``\run_opt.py``. The functions for the generation of random clusters (Isotropic Gaussian blobs and Two "half-moons") are ``kmodes.py``.
